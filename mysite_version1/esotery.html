    <h1 style="color: white;" class="bgtitle">Esotery</h1>
  </div>
  <p class="description">I know a lot of people are sceptical regarding esotery, and that is fine, we don't all have to believe in everything, but I do like to think that life is
    a bit more complex in terms of what happens to us. I'm especially interested in Astrology. So don't mind me asking to know your zodiac sign, what sign your moon is in and what is your ascendent.
    Mine is Leo - Cancer - Leo in order. I find it truly fascinating how much one can tell (one meaning someone who has learned astrology of course) from a chart made up of symbols of planets, zodiac signs that are 
    located in certain "houses" (12) at certain degrees. I had several instances when I relied on the help of an astrologer, and with the insight I gained from the consultation
    I could view the situation I was in from a different perspective and it helped me understand why it is that way and what I could learn from it. And yes there were times when I was
    having a hard time understanding why people close to me would act a certain way but astrology was there to give a bit of a <i>behind the scenes.</i> I also pay close attention to the Moon.
    It really makes sense that it affects how we feel, and how we feel affects how we react/behave. Considering the Moon's effect on tides, and that we are made up of roughly 60% of water (roughly based on age, sex, hydration)
    it makes sense.
    <br>When in doubt, and also for an everyday 'what to focus on' I like to draw a card from a Tarot deck or oracle deck. Nothing witchy here. Sometimes I do readings as well, for myself and also for friends.
    Most of the times it is very accurate. I do not think of it as fortune telling, as no one can really tell what the future will be, it is only an insight into what could happen in the future, but of course it depends on my actions.
    I know I'm repeating myself here, but the cards also help with understanding current situations and myself as well.
