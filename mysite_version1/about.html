    <p>a-s-l: 29 (soon to be 30,) - <s>femme fatale</s> just kidding - Budapest, Hungary

    <h3>a bit more info:</h3>
    <p>Born in 1993 in Nyíregyháza, Hungary, went to primary school and secondary school here (the latter is where I had a preparatory year of learning English).
      While attending said secondary school I had the chance (thanks to my mom) to do an exchange year in the USA - Semmes, Alabama to be exact - and attended Mary G. Montgomery
      High School for 10 months. Needless to say it was one of the best experiences I could have had as a teenager as it helped me become more independent, break out of my shell and comfort zone.
      After finishing my secondary studies in 2012 I decided to try my luck abroad and moved to London, UK in October. After a rough start I managed to land two jobs at once, doing full time at a 
      restaurant - more like a salad bar (Tossed UK) - and doing part time at a vintage tea room (Betty Blythe). It was definitely a busy time in my life and it had its ups and downs. A little less than 1.5 years later
      I felt burnt out and decided to leave my London life behind and moved back to Nyíregyháza. Applied for uni and got accepted to BKF (now Metropolitan University) where I started studying media and communications, where 
      I loved the media part (learnt how to use Photoshop, Premiere Pro) but not so much the communications part so I only attended it for a year. Then I applied for English studies at Károli Gáspár University of the Reformed Church and got accepted. 
      During the first year I had an urge to do something business related, so I came up with the idea of doing a subscription box service and that is how <b><a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fthesnackbox.wixsite.com%2Fnasidoboz%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1c9fjJpXssImlWbP5_O8mqOV4BTq9vtu_KBZ0P9jRfI0lfREkKCXXyx-g&h=AT2ZEetqB1An6hXXCJNh0pSGLZYjZJP7sUrqg48UmfDBYPiRJgx9Au8RlSrpWuxDDzQDybxZHAv97Wo6JIF_EAuldCY9nlbIVU6LnoBrVd2lVkoS3MozDSUEQpHOxdtCgEVBcYGnuq0-MTm3Cyo">Snackbox</a></b> - 
      <b>the box of healthy snacks</b> (the original domain is no longer registered), was born - it was one of the firsts, and I am so very proud of myself that I dared to do it alone even though I had no experience in anything related to business.
      It was a good first experience even though I ran out of capital within a year. I closed those doors and went on studying.
      Not sure if it's a generational issue but after 1.5 years I felt a bit unmotivated to continue uni and took a gap semester then another then studied a little and then another gap semester. In these gap semesters I started working:
      first I did a student job for a month at Budapest XIV.District's government office where I met my soon to be boss (now ex boss). I became the assistant to the district's head gardener (főkertészi asszisztens) and after that month I remained his personal assistant.
      I helped in the making of his youtube videos, radio podcast, I managed his social media, worked on his website and took way too many photos and videos with a Nikon D750.
      Through him I met many noteworthy people and my other boss also, and in 2019 I started working for Borhy Kertészet, where i did a variety of activites: administration, packaging plants and coordinating their shipment, caring for the plants (including planting and trimming), 
      the bulding of their new webshop, etc. In January 2022 I finally submitted my thesis and graduated uni and felt the need to make use of my English knowledge. After much consideration I decided to apply for a job at IBM and leave my beloved job at the garden centre behind.
      Started working at IBM March 2022 as an executive administrative assistant and am still in that job role.
